# Design

## Design answers

* Each gameplay period before set "progression points" should be about 5-10 minutes(?)

## Design questions

* FactionResourceType enum as flags? So we don't repeat the same multipier for each resource.
* Gameplay periods length
* Meaningful choices
	* Build paths (needing to choose between factions, and their upgrades/alliances)
	* Needing to wait for an upgrade to be effective (SwarmSim-esque)
	* Some upgrades being bad/terrible early game
	* Some upgrades being great right now, but hurting the player (slightly) later?
	* Special progress upgrades
* "Dangerous" Upgrades would make it possible to have a prestige system, making the resets fun, to make "builds"

## Progression

### Early game, to 10000 light/dark start

...

### Early game, heat start

10000 light upg = unlock light generates heat.
1 heat pop = 1 heat, 1 essence

To generating more heat from heat than light
To 100/1000 heat?

### Early game, ocean start

Dark, light?, heat?

### Mid game, nature start

Light, water, heat-.
