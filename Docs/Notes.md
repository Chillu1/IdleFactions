# Notes

## Temp Notes
Homm like factions/cities, with building choices.
Factions interact with each other, using each other resources.

First you only have base factions
Then to ex. create humans, you need skeletons, food, wildlife, wood, etc

Light/Darkness generation is probably very limited.
Makes it so player has to player around this limitation (& the limitation doesn't feel bad).

Light:
Nature, Treant, Human, Mage, Warlock, Drowner

Food is needed by:
Human,

Water is needed by:
Treants, Nature, Human

Skeletons are needed by:
Human, Drowner?, Warlock

Mana is needed by:
Warlock

## Ideas
Choose "good" or "evil" start.
Makes it so you have a very basic income of light/dark.

Worlds?
Starting world has X factions, ex. need X skeletons to get to another world? Kinda meh?
