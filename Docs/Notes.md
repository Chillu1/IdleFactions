First you only have base factions
Then to ex. create humans, you need skeletons, food, wildlife, wood, etc

Light/Darkness generation is probably very limited.
Makes it so player has to player around this limitation (& the limitation doesn't feel bad).

Light:
Nature, Treant, Human, Mage, Warlock, Drowner

Food is needed by:
Human,

Water is needed by:
Treants, Nature, Human

Skeletons are needed by:
Human, Drowner?, Warlock

Mana is needed by:
Warlock

## Ideas
Each faction shares some upgrades, raw production, automatic, etc.
And each faction has a unique set of buildings.

Choose "good" or "evil" start.
Makes it so you have a very basic income of light/dark.

Worlds?
Starting world has X factions, ex. need X skeletons to get to another world? Kinda meh?
