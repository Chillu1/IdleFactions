* Resource needs tied to each other, by type%? (Ex. Skeleton farming upgrade consumes wildlife, but other gens aren't affected. While dark & magic affect everything 100%)
* Separate generated population & bought?
* Capping population/auto toggle generation to a limit (ex. so we don't have 1000 skeletons draining all dark & magic)
* Rates
