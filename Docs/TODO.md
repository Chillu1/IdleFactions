# TODO:

* Unlockable faction upgrades, to unlock on X, or set resource amount
* Faction UI
  * Faction art
* Basic progression. Light/Dark, Water. Prob skip early game & design mid-game, easier to figure out properly
  * Warlocks
    Necro
    Skeletons (like humans, but far worse, can be upgraded to do, food, stone, wood, etc?)
    Demons

## Misc

* General multiplier upgrade needs, instead of X resources
* Separate generated population & bought?
* Capping population/auto toggle generation to a limit (ex. so we don't have 1000 skeletons draining all dark & magic)
* Rates
* Buying 1-10-25-100-10%-25%-50%-Max population
