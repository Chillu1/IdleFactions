# TODO:

* Save state
* Refactor to not use "GetResource"
* Buying 10%-25%-50%-Max population
* Rate
* Resource needs tied to each other, by type%? (Ex. Skeleton farming upgrade consumes wildlife, but other gens aren't affected. While dark & magic affect everything 100%)
* Separate generated population & bought?
* Buying next most with 10-100 population?

## Tests

* UpgradeActionGeneralMultiplier
* Added tests

## Ideal Product

* UI
  * Faction
    * Upgrade
      * Hover over for info panel
        * Name
        * Description
        * Costs
        * Effects
    * Population 1-100%
    * Art
    * Rates

## Misc

* Capping population/auto toggle generation to a limit (ex. so we don't have 1000 skeletons draining all dark & magic)
* Update current UI unlocked upgrade if factionType is same as UI
* Achivements
  * Bonus multipliers? Then we should have more meaningful achievements, not "100 X resource"
* Offline progress (max 24h/time resource)
